## Designs:

### Version 1:
As the client had no initial preferences on how the website looked, a single page design was mocked up to spark ideas. This design features a clear image of a boat on the water with two separate sections dedicated to displaying who the business is, and a contact form.

### Version 2:
The client provided feedback and wished to add some information about some of the core services they offer. This version shows a single page with the existing information as well as an additional section with some core services.

### Version 3:
The client provided more feedback and requested that the website is broken up into several different pages so they can expand on each element. This design allows for multiple pages: The landing page, About Us page, Our Services page and Contact Us page. The landing page is designed to be easy to view with the information about who the business is and their contact information. The other pages have been populated with real content as the client was able to provide it at this stage. We can see the website taking shape clearly outlining their services and who each employee is. This also saw the introduction of a brighter header as requested by the client.

### Version 4:
This version is the final draft which tweaked some minor things such as the way the contact page looks and a darker header as requested by the client. The image used in the landing page is now an image from the local that the business operates
